User inputs include:
  - Train Name
  - Destination
  - Time of First Train

Since this application needs to output the user's next train arrival, I needed to be able to store the user input data in a database to be able to use to calculate the arrival time. I decided to start with the storage problem which was solved with the use of Firebase to store the user data. The next problem to tackle was time conversion which was solved by using Moment.js. The remaining issues were solved by setting up variables to hold the user data in order to be able to pass to the database and to perform calculations and dynimcally push the user output to the DOM.
